# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

## Git config
1. Make a file in your home directory called `.gitconfig-user` and add your user information. For example:
```
[user]
  name = <first name and last name>
  email = <email address>
```
